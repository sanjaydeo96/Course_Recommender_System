# Course_Recommender_System
To upgrade skills using L&amp;D course portal, people have to navigate a lot in order to get relevant courses. This is time consuming and sometime people realise in the middle of the course that this is not what they were looking for. In order to solve this problem, we designed and developed Course Recommender System for an organisation L&amp;D department.
Basic idea of recommending courses was to use collaborative technique of recommendation (Prediction based on users current skillset mentioned in their profile). 

User skills → Data cleaning → Word2Vec → Average skill → Top5 predicted skill
